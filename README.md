# portfolio_bootstrap
This project is about modifying the previous portfolio project to include bootstrap css framework. This is to ensure that we have a responsive layout. We also include navbars and other bootstrap components and enable the webpage to resize according to the screen size.

We use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns). On an xs screen, the content should take up the entire screen. On sm and larger screens, we should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen.
